# This program doesn't work any more

### Background
Program that would allow the user to feed in a text file with a list of company/client names and get their addresses in a regular format from Google Maps.

### Why it sucks
It wasn't anything too clever - in fact it was almost too stupid. It literally did a Google maps search, then read the resulting page's source. It doesn't work any more because the source code of Google Maps pages is completely different now. Next time, maybe consider using the goshdarn [API](https://developers.google.com/maps/).

### How to use it
Don't.
