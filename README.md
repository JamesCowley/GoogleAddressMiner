# This program doesn't work any more

### Background

Program that would allow the user to feed in a text file with a list of company/client names and get their addresses in a regular format from Google Maps.

### Why it sucks

* **It was poorly written:** this was the first real-world application I ever made in Java, and as such it is 80% hack and 20% luck.

* **It was poorly conceived:** no sensible [API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) implementation here, nope... It works by building a Google Maps URL string, getting the whole webpage for that search and then looking through the page source. Unsurprisingly, Google Maps has changed its layout and functionality a little bit, rendering this method utterly useless.

### How to use it

Firstly, **don't**.

But if you do, choose either [ScannerWithRegions.java](GoogleMapsMiner/ScannerWithRegions.java) *or* [ScannerAll.java](GoogleMapsMiner/ScannerAll.java) as the main method-containing file in your [MANIFEST.MD](MANIFEST.MD). Then, make sure to hard-code the path to a text file with a list of company information into the main method of whichever one you chose. Then, it will fail to get anything from Google Maps because the Google Maps source code has changed.
